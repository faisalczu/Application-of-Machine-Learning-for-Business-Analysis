# Application of Machine Learning for Business Analysis
 ### Master Thesis Project@CZU - python with supporting libraries!

In the practical section of thesis, to generate the process of loan status using python tools, supplied a dataset to identify the customers segments that are suitable for loan grant, build a model by analyze the raw dataset and the changes it gradually in order to get it ready for machine learning model training. This model will be created using data mining task and machine learning algorithms. This approach to help to finance company to determine whether applicants grant for loan using previous historical data.

### Data set consists of following variables to analysis EDA and implementation of machine learning algorithms and model accuracy level for further deployment of model on real MLOPS systems.

#### 1. Loan_ID,
#### 2. Gender,
#### 3. Married,
#### 4. Dependents,
#### 5. Education,
#### 6. Self_Employed,
#### 7. ApplicantIncome,
